# WebStorm Darcula VSCode theme
As close as possible to [IntelliJ WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) Darcula theme, (and some improvements)

![Preview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/imekachi/webstorm-darcula/master/images/preview.png)

I've tried most of IntelliJ Darcula theme available on VSCode marketplace, none of them is close enough to the WebStorm vibe for my liking, so I decided to create my own.

## Installation
[Download from VS Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=imekachi.webstorm-darcula)

## Language Support
- Javascript
- TypeScript
- React, Svelte, Vue, Angular
- GraphQL
- HTML
- PHP
- Markdown
- JSON
- shell script (.sh)
- CSS, SCSS, TailwindCSS, styled-components
- Dockerfile, Docker compose file
- (And more by you guys...)

## Contribution
If you want to add more language support or have any idea to improve syntax highlighting, feel free to make a pull request.

## Additional highlighting
- Git status in filename (Add, Modify, Untracked, removed)
- Git status for each line after line number
- Filename background highlighting
- Diff editor
- Search text

## Limitation
Since VSCode relies on textmate scopes as a selector for theme which sometimes cannot differentiate some syntax like WebStorm. I cannot highlight some syntax, for example, global variables in JS, Generic Type in TS.
